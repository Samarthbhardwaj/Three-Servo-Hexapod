# Three Servo Hexapod Project Summary
Hello! 
Im Samarth Bhardwaj currently pursuing btech 
Computer Science  2nd year
## Project Outline
The aim of this project was to learn new things related to arduino controlling servos by building a three servo hexapod robot. A hexapod is a six-legged robot that can walk on different terrains and perform various tasks. A three servo hexapod uses only three servos to control the movement of six legs, which makes it more cost-effective and energy-efficient than a six servo hexapod.

## Objectives
The objectives of this project were to:
- Design and build a three servo hexapod robot from scratch using arduino and other materials
- Program the arduino to control the servos and make the hexapod move in different directions
- Test and evaluate the performance of the hexapod on different surfaces and scenarios

## Audience
The audience of this project are hobbyists, students, and researchers who are interested in robotics, arduino, and servos. This project can provide them with a practical example of how to build and program a three servo hexapod robot using simple and affordable materials.

## Project Scope
The scope of this project was limited by the following factors:
- Budget: The total cost of the materials was around $50, which included an arduino board, three servos, wires, batteries, screws, nuts, bolts, etc.
- Time: The project took about two months to complete, from designing to testing.
- Resources: The project required basic tools such as a soldering iron, a drill, a screwdriver, etc. It also required a computer with an arduino IDE software and a USB cable to upload the code to the arduino board.
- Skills: The project required basic skills in electronics, mechanics, programming, and mathematics.

## Summary
This project was about learning new things related to arduino controlling servos by building a three servo hexapod robot. The hexapod robot was designed and built from scratch using simple and affordable materials. The arduino board was programmed to control the servos and make the hexapod move in different directions. The hexapod robot was tested and evaluated on different surfaces and scenarios. The main challenge of this project was to figure out how to make the hexapod move left and right using only three servos. This required writing a lot of codes and calculating the angles and distances of each leg movement. The project was successful in achieving its objectives and demonstrating how a three servo hexapod robot can be built and programmed using arduino and servos.
